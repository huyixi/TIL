Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly good to eat.

This is because honey has a very low water content and is highly acidic, making it impossible for bacteria or microorganisms to survive in it. Additionally, bees add an enzyme called glucose oxidase that produces hydrogen peroxide, further preserving the honey.
