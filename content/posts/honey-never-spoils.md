### [How generalists learn 通才如何学习](https://davidasboth.com/learning-as-a-data-generalist)
- [you] don't need to learn everything up front, [you] just need to be confident enough that [you] can learn anything when [you] need to
你不需要预先学习所有的东西，你只需要有足够的信心，这样当你需要的时候，你就能学到任何东西

- I've never really understood why I struggled to follow a textbook from start to finish. What I now realise is I lacked a goal. Learning algorithm X or method Y for its own sake isn't an interesting enough goal. Solving a problem, answering a question (however trivial) - those are.
我从来没有真正理解为什么我会费力地从头到尾跟着一本教科书学习。我现在意识到我缺乏一个目标。学习算法 X 或方法 Y 本身并不是一个足够有趣的目标。解决问题、回答问题（无论多么微不足道）——这些才是。
